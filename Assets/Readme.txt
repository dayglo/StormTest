Sample Scenes Setup
=====================
Due to technical limitations, the package doesn't include any build settings which means the scenes list is not configured by default. 
In order to use the sample browser, you must set this up manually:

1. Open your project's build settings via File > Build Settings. 
2. Locate the various scene files in the package's FingerGestures\Samples\Scenes folders
3. Drag & drop all the scenes files you find to the Build Settings window's "Scenes in Build" list
4. Ensure that the "Start" scene is the first item in the list
5. Make a standalone or web-browser build and run it to try out the sample browser
