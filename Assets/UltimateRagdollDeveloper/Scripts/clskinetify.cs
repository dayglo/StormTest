/// DESIGNED WITH UNITY 3.4.1f5
/// 
/// This is a very simple helper class that demonstrates the use of the new clskinetify utility, that
/// turns a kinematic ragdoll into a driven ragdoll. This class is particularly useful to animate 'roadside' objects
/// or scenery objects that need to become physical when they receive a trigger (or otherwise a collision when implemented like so)
/// using this class can save time and resources in those cases, since it avoids the use of a specific ragdoll prefab and a separate
/// scripted gameobject
/// </summary>

		//cycle the rigidbodies and turn them into physics driven objects

			varcurrentrigidbody.isKinematic = false;
